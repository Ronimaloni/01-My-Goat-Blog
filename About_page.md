My name is Erin Ingalsbe and I am the author of this blog. I am a native of Niangua, Missouri living right along the Osage River which is where I get the name of my farm, Osage Acres. On my farm, I raise Boer goats and a variety of chickens and geese. I gained my experience of goats and poultry from being in 4-H for 13 years. My love of goats evolved into a entrepreneurship of raising and selling them.

My business is currently put on hold as I am a senior at College of the Ozarks. I am majoring in Agribusiness with a minor in Chemistry. Weird combination huh? I am studying Agribusiness because I hope that it will help me grow my own farm someday. While in college I discovered that I really like chemistry, so I minored in that because it's near impossible to make enough money solely from a hobby farm. Go figure!

I am hopeful that this blog will reach people who are interested in raising goats and who are just as confused as I was so many years ago. I hope to take a little bit of the stress away from raising goats by providing information on all the issues I had to figure out on my own.Â  I hope you enjoy reading this blog, and remember, it's whatever floats your goat!
