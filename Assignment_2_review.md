# One thing I learned.

I learned the format of Wordpress, which is cool, because I have never made a blog before. I highly doubt if I will continue with the blog I made unless it somehow miraculously becomes popular.


# One thing that is still unclear.

If I actually will make a decent grade on this monstrosity since the standards of which it is graded are fuzzy. I still followed the assignment page to the best of my ability, and made this blog pertinent to me and the circle if people in this audience. The whole schedule is smushed at the end, hurriedly put together. This is a large project, and you still dont allow very much time to complete it. I still don't really know what you are wanting out of this project, but I made a blog. Yipee!
