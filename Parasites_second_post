# Eliminating Parasites

When raising goats, there are a few things to be watching for, especially pertaining to their overall health. One very common problem to watch for is parasites. All goat breeds, meat goats or dairy goats, are susceptible to parasites. The term parasite is just a general term for organisms which are usually worms. Worming goats is a lot like worming dogs, except goats won’t sit down and scoot their butt across the carpet. You will need to use other methods in determining if your goats have worms or not. Some goat breeders worm their goats on a regular basis, usually twice a year in the spring and in the fall, to account for worms so they won’t have to check their goats. The downside to this method is that the worms will build up a resistance to the wormer medication if it is used too frequently. This will make the medication not work near as effectively as it used to, or sometimes not at all. The best method is to look at the goat’s gums and the inside of their eyelid. This normally pink flesh will be white when the goat has worms. Their flesh is white there because the worms are blood-sucking parasites. (literally!) The worms attach themselves to the lining of the stomach and digestive system and feed on the blood. This becomes a problem when there are too many parasites and the animal becomes weakened because of blood loss, lower immune system, or even get an infection because of the worms.
