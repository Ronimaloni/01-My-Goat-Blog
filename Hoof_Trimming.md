Because Boer goats originated from the South African Boer goats and are relatives of the mountain goats, their hooves grow just like they would on the mountainside. In America, most Boer goats are raised in pastures, with lush grass instead of rocky terrain. Because rhey have different living situations, the goat's hooves grow out alot faster becasue there are no rocks to smooth out and wear down their hooves. Therefore, it is up to the goat owner to care for this common problem in goats. This problem occurs in all goats, and some goat's hooves grow out faster than others. This is a trait that you can selectively breed for. 

# Checking for Over-grown Hooves. 

Knowing how to tell when a goats needs its hooved trimmed is a vital part to caring for your goats. When one of your goats needs a trim, it might be limping, favoring one leg over another because of mud or infection that has settled into the hoof. They will also prance more, raising their front legs higher and kicking them out more. The best way to tell is by looking right at the hoof. When the hoof needs to be trimmed, the hard outside wall of the hoof will be grown out and curled under, and pointing out, looking alot like elf shoes. When the goat's hooves are grown out like this, it hinders the way they walk, their mobility, and eventually their health since they won't want to stand to eat.

# How to Trim Hooves. 

Before trimming your goat's hooves, you need the right equipment. First, you will need hoof trimmers, which look like pruning shears. You also might like a pick to remove the caked mud and debris. A rope to secure the goat will be necessary, and a stanchion to stand the goat on to get it off the ground is beneficial, but optional. Once you have your goat secure, stand next to it facing its backside. grab its leg next to its ankle and lift, bending the leg at the knee. You can push your elbow into the goat's side for leverage. Take the pick and clean out any debris, then take the hoof trimmers and clip the hoof starting at the toe. Try to make the hoof even to where it is parallel with the ground. The toe of the hoof grows faster so you will have to trim more of it to make the hoof even again. Sometimes the hoof wall will separate from the sole and that provides a pocket for infection and mud to reside. make sure to cut as much of this out as you can so the hoof can heal nad not be infected. Infections can be painful and cause harm the immune system. The infected pockets in the hoof is called hoof rot. When your begin trimming into the sole of the hoof instead of just the overgrown wall, be sure to watch for the quick. You can see when you are close becasue the sole will become pinkish. The quick is the same as in dogs, and is similar to the nail bed for humans. it is an area of blood vessels and nerve endings, and it is painful to cut into. Sometimes it is necessary to cut a little too far just for the sake of getting a spot of hoof rot out, but this should be done sparingly. When you cut the quick, the goat will bleed a little bit, but its nothing to worry about. The goat's hoof will be a bit tender, but it will heal quickly. A safer method of trimming hooves is cutting small amounts at a time until its fairly even, then waiting about two weeks for the hoof to grow a bit and for the quick to recede. Then you can cut a little more to get the hoof evened out and all the infection cut out.

# Story Time!

One of the does on my farm is very prone to getting hoof rot. She has this rotten spot in the cleft of her hoof that keeps coming back every couple of weeks. I have battling this infection with her since early spring of 2018. It has been a really damp year, and the fields my goats are in have been constantly wet which creates a optimal living condition for bacteria and infection. hoof rot is actually caused by a bacteria called Porphyromonas levii. The rotting hoof and low immune system are symptoms of this bacteria. Treatment for hoof rot includes trimming the hoof often to clean out any infection, and giving doses of an antibiotic called LA-200. This pairing usually does a really good job of getting rid of hoof rot, but this doe keeps getting it and has been for a year. I think this is becasue of two things: one, she is prone to the disease, and two, it has been really wet in her field this year and the mud has not been allowing her to heal. Luckily, she is doing better and is beginnig to heal and gain her weight back.
